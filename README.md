# random-walk-simulation
A Python project that simulates a random walk using dice rolls. The program generates random numbers, simulates dice rolls, and tracks a step value that fluctuates based on the outcome of the dice rolls. It includes simulations with varying behaviors, such as limiting the step value to prevent negative steps.
