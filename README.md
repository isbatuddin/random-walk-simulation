Random Walk Simulation
This project demonstrates a random walk simulation using Python and NumPy. The simulation uses dice rolls to determine movement and includes logic to adjust behavior such as preventing negative steps.

Features
Generate random numbers with reproducible results using seeds.
Simulate dice rolls to determine step changes.
Visualize random walks over 100 steps or more.
Implement custom behavior like bounds to prevent negative steps.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
NumPy library
